# PythonTicTacToe
 This Python project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns placing their respective symbols (X and O) on a grid. The game allows for different grid sizes (3x3, 4x4, or 5x5) and supports the standard win conditions: a player wins if they place three consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  The game includes features such as:  A customizable game board size (default is 3x3). Win detection through various directions (rows, columns, diagonals). A hint system to help players identify potential winning moves. Functions that determine if the board is full and check if a player has won. A graphical interface using SimpleGraphics for rendering the board and managing player interactions.
